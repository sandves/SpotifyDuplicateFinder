# SpotifyDuplicateFinder
A Python module that can be used to detect duplicates in Spotify playlists.

## Usage

1. Find a playlist that you want to examine, hit Ctrl + A and drag the content over to a text file. The default file name is `tracks.txt` but this can be whatever you want as long as you specify it in code. 
2. Run `main.py`.
3. The duplicate tracks, if any, will be written to a file called `duplicates.txt`.
